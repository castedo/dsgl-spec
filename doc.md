    **DOCUMENT TYPE**: Living Technical Specification

    A document succession is a distributed, correctable document that preserves document
    snapshots as editions, which can be individually referenced.
    The Document Succession Git Layout (DSGL) is a format for storing document successions
    within a Git object store.
    DSGL bridges two related formats: the textual representation of
    [Document Succession Identifiers (DSI)](https://perm.pub/1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo)
    and the storage format for document snapshots.
    An example of a snapshot format is the format for Baseprint document snapshots;
    however, this specification does not define any specific format for document snapshots.
    This DSGL specification details a Git storage layout that interoperates with the
    [Hidos Python package](https://pypi.org/project/hidos/) version 1.3 and the [Document
    Succession Highly Manual Toolkit](https://manual.perm.pub).

## Background

Websites, such as [https://perm.pub](https://perm.pub),
use free open-source software, such as the Python package
[Epijats](https://gitlab.com/perm.pub/epijats),
to process the formats of
Document Succession Git Layout (DSGL),
[Document Succession Identifiers (DSI)](https://perm.pub/1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo),
and Baseprint document snapshots.
For the motivation behind these technologies,
refer to [Why Publish Baseprint Document Successions](
https://perm.pub/wk1LzCaCSKkIvLAYObAvaoLNGPc
).
Tutorials and introductory material are also available at
[https://try.perm.pub/](https://try.perm.pub).

## Scope

This document is a specification of DSGL that interoperates with these reference
implementations:

* the Python package [Hidos](https://pypi.org/project/hidos/) [@hidos:1.3] and
* the [Document Succession Highly Manual Toolkit](https://manual.perm.pub) [@dshmtm].

This specification does not include potential DSGL feature that are not implemented in
any software.
The online forum <https://baseprints.singlesource.pub> is available for proposals
of improvements to this living specification and reference implementations.

### Signed Successions

This specification is for document successions that are digitally signed.
*Unsigned* document successions are out of the scope for this edition of the
DSGL specification.
Unsigned document successions can be useful for testing and learning purposes,
but are not critical to interoperability.

### Ungarbled Successions

This specification is for a definition of DSGL for *ungarbled* recordings.
An *ungarbled* recording is most likely to interoperate and is intuitively the
ideal way one would record the data of a document succession. 
Reality and non-ideal circumstances sometimes result in *garbled* recordings.
Implemented software will be able to deal with *garbled* recordings to varying levels of satisfaction.
This specification assumes document successions are *ungarbled*, unless otherwise noted.

## Informal Description

### Initial Git Commit

A document succession consists of a Git commit history with a single initial commit.
The base DSI of the document succession is the base64url (RFC 4648)[@rfc4648]
representation of the 20-byte binary Git hash of the initial commit.
An *ungarbled* document succession has a linear Git commit history.

### Signatures

Every commit tree contain a `signed_succession` subdirectory
that includes an `allowed_signers` file listing the public keys
allowed to extend the document succession.
Each line in the `allowed_signers` file begins with `* namespaces="git" ` followed by
space-separated fields of a keytype and a base64-encoded public key
as supported by OpenSSH.
The keytype of `ssh-ed25519` is well tested, broadly adopted, and featured in the
[Document Succession Highly Manual Toolkit Manual](https://manual.perm.pub) [@dshmtm].

The initial commit is signed with an SSH key that is listed in the `allowed_signers` file.
Each non-initial commit is signed with an SSH key listed in the `allowed_signers` files of
all of its parent commits.

**Example** : Initial Git commit in DSGL.

> <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:rev:d7014686f9aff1765f3f1d0ee47c9ad9ef40c97a>


### Document Snapshot

A document snapshot in DSGL is any digital object
that can be encoded as either a Git blob or Git tree.
The contents of each document snapshot are stored in a Git commit tree with a path
consisting of the edition number tuple components separated by slashes and then the
file/directory name `object`.
For example,
a directory as the contents of a document snapshot that is edition 1
is stored at a directory path `1/object` that corresponds to a Git tree.

Every document snapshot in a document succession has an edition number tuple that ends
in a positive integer.
For instance, `10` is a valid edition number whereas `1.0` is not.
Formally, the edition number `10` is the tuple `(10)` and `1.0` is the tuple `(1,0)`.

For each edition number, the first commit that stores the document snapshot 
is the only valid data for that edition number.
An ungarbled document succession only has one commit that sets the document snapshot
assigned to an edition number.
If a subsequent commit stores a different document snapshot at the path of a previously
store edition path,
it does not change what is the correct value of the edition in the document succession.

> Hidos 1.3 will automatically return only the first document snapshot committed and
> will ignore invalid snapshots of subsequent commits.

Formal Definitions
------------------

### Criteria for a document succession in DSGL

**Criterion**:
The data of a document succession are fully recorded by a connected graph of Git commit
records.

**Criterion**:
There is only one initial Git commit (a commit without parents) in the graph of Git
commit records. The 20-byte binary hash of this initial Git commit is the hash
used for the base DSI of the document succession.

**Criterion**:
All document snapshots are stored as a Git blob or Git tree with the name `object`
(in its containing Git tree).

**Criterion**:
The Git tree containing an `object` entry for a document snapshot is not
the top-level Git commit tree and it named with a positive integer.

**Criterion**:
The full path to the containing tree of an `object` entry for a document snapshot
consists of non-negative integers separated by slashes.
These non-negative integer correspond to the non-negative integers separated
by stops (periods) in the DSI.

**Criterion**:
The document snapshot assigned to an edition number is the first Git blob or tree
committed to an `object` entry following the path corresponding to the edition number.
Any subsequent `object` entries at this path do not change the DSI assignment.

### Criteria for a **signed** document succession in DSGL

**Criterion**:
The Git tree of every Git commit record has an `allowed_signers` file within the
`signed_succession` directory.

**Criterion**:
The `allowed_signers` file consists of zero or more lines of four space-separated
fields. The second field is `namespaces="git"`, the third field is an OpenSSH compatible
keytype and the fourth field is a base64-encoded public key.

**Criterion**:
Every commit with parents is signed with an SSH key with the public key
listed in the `allowed_signers` file of all parent commits.

### Criteria for an **ungarbled** document succession in DSGL

**Criterion**:
The graph of Git commit records is linear.

**Criterion**:
The initial commit is signed with an SSH key that is listed in the `allowed_signers`
file within the `signed_succession` directory.

**Criterion**:
The first field of all lines in the `allowed_signers` files is the character `*`.

**Criterion**:
The third field of all lines in the `allowed_signers` files is the keytype
`ssh-ed25519`.

**Criterion**:
All paths of all Git commit trees match the EBNF grammar for DSGL Paths (definition
follows).

**Criterion**:
Every `object` entry is only added once in the commit history.

**Criterion**:
There are no two `object` entries whose paths correspond to edition numbers that are
above or below each other (for example, `1/object` and `1/2/object` are not both
present).


### DSGL Paths in Extended Backusâ€”Naur Form

Note that `[ x ] * N` matches zero to N repetitions of `x`.

```
path ::= "signed_succession/allowed_signers" | snapshot
snapshot ::= ( [ non_neg_int "/" ] * 3 ) pos_int "/object" ;
non_neg_int ::= "0" | pos_int ;
pos_int ::= pos_dec_digit ( [ dec_digit ] * 3 ) ;
dec_digit := "0" | pos_dec_digit;
pos_dec_digit := "1" ... "9" ;
```

Discussion
----------

### Related Concepts

A *Document Succession Identifier* is an
[intrinsic identifier](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2020/07/09/intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-identifiers)
[@intrinsic_extrinsic_identifiers] [@cosmo_referencing_2020] [@dicosmo:hal-01865790]
of the initial Git commit.

### Design Choice Rationales

#### Separation of Git History from Edition History

Representing the history of editions through means other than Git commit history
is a deliberate design choice.
Git commit history records all Git actions,
which can lead to inflexible and complicated non-linear histories.
Software Heritage automatically preserves Git commits,
increasing the risk that a Git commit history could become
an unintended complicated non-linear history.
Non-linear Git commit histories and merge commits might be useful in certain scenarios.

Separating edition history from Git commit history also allows
for future enhancements, such as retracting specific editions.

#### Use of Git Tree Paths Instead of Git Tags

In document successions, edition numbers are akin to software release versions,
which are typically identified using Git tags.
However, this specification adopts a different approach.
Edition numbers are recorded with file paths in Git trees rather than Git tags.
With this approach, a single latest Git commit captures a complete record of a document succession.
This means copying document successions is as easy as copying Git branches.
This is especially useful when consolidating records from multiple sources into a single Git repository.

In contrast, software projects, which often include release tags,
are copied by cloning the entire repository.
Using Git tags for edition numbers would
introduce the complexity of keeping a branch and edition number tags in sync,
thereby increasing the risk of problems during copying.

While branches in Git repositories are useful for managing document successions,
branch names do not constitute a part of the document succession record.
